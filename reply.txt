Hello, thanks for reaching out.

I did some research on Asset Management, turns out several positions has sponsored past years in NJ, TX,NC.
So if I could matching the record, salary should between 85000-10500/year.
I would like to be a quantitative developer rather than currently role- a data engineer. 
Salary, location and other impacts will not affect too match for my desicion. 

Attachment is my resume.

I'm currently working as a Data Engineer at ICBC, daily using Python and SQL.

My working status is F1 OPT (STEM extension started on 07/16/2021, ends on 07/16/2023) so I do need sponsorship.
You can contact me between 6pm-10pm NY (GMT-4)starting by 08/26/2021, with my number 4806287726. 
I can start the new role on October, looking forward for interviews.
